# Windows multi-window sample

This repository contains an experimental Flutter Windows app that launches
multiple windows. This sample requires
[Flutter's `master` channel](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/upgrade#changing-channels).

This sample is aspirational, may not actually work, may be outdated, and/or have
other issues. This sample links against experimental Flutter Windows APIs that
may break at any time. DO NOT DEPEND ON ANYTHING IN THIS REPOSITORY.
